                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

               Why do we use it?
                        We are often asked what makes a brilliant text message. There is no right answer to this as there is no
                such thing as a size that fits all, but there are SMS templates that have proven to be effective for
                businesses. All of them share the following elements: powerful call-to-action triggers; the sender’s ID,
                name and phone number; and, occasionally, a short link to the sender’s website.

                In a recent post, Neil Patel mentioned that simply slapping a few common call-to-action triggers in an
                email or SMS won’t cut it, because the perfect call to action has to resonate with the audience and
                create a sense of urgency (example: words like ‘today’ and ‘now’). With these things in mind, we have
                created a list of ready-to-use text message templates for small businesses.

                Marketing and Promotional SMS Templates.
                Appointment Reminders.
                SMS Notifications and Alerts.
                SMS Confirmations.
                Payment Reminders.
                Banking Templates.
                SMS Polls.
                SMS Contest Templates.
                Staff Communication.
                Marketing and Promotional SMS Templates
                The marketing and promotional SMS templates listed below work because they are attention grabbers, they
                use powerful calls to action, they create a sense of urgency, and they share information in a clear and
                concise manner. Feel free to experiment with the wording of your messages, monitor their performance and
                tweak them based on your audience’s response.
